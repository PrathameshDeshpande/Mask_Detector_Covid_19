# Mask_Detector_Covid_19
This is a real-time DL model to classify if a person is wearing Mask or not
First File is a traditional ConvNet Model
Traditional Model got an accuracy of 96% on Validation set which of 20% of the total dataset
The second file is a model based on Inception-V3 CNN trained on imagnet dataset
With the help of Transfer Learning I achieved an accuracy of 97%
Since imagnet dataset doesn't contain human picture. Transfer Learning wasn't so efficient
